## Requirements

- Ansible 2.9 or later  
- Managed nodes must be running a Debian/Ubuntu-based OS  
- Python should be installed on the target machines (Ansible requirement)

| Variable Name | Default Value | Description |

| `apache_package` | `apache2` | Name of the Apache package to install |
| `html_src` | `index.html` | Name of the custom HTML file located in the `files/` directory |
| `html_dest` | `/var/www/html/index.html` | Destination path for the HTML file on the managed node |
